Configured keybinds need to match your in-game keybinds for equipment selection and equipment use.
This program will intercept the "Equipment Switch" input and fire both the "Equipment Switch" and "Use Equipment" inputs instead.

The "Grapple with Use Equipment key" option makes the "Use Equipment" key fire the grappleshot.
Useful for keeping the same key for "Use Equipment" in multiplayer and "Fire Grappleshot" in singleplayer.
