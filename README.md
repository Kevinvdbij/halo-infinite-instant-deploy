### How to use
There are two ways to use this program:
1. Clone (or download as zip) the project and run the InstantDeploy.ahk file with AutoHotkey
2. Download and run the standalone executable from [releases](https://github.com/Kevinvdbij/halo-infinite-instant-deploy/releases).

### Keybinds
You can set the keybinds by clicking the "Set" button and pressing your desired key.
The configured keybinds need to match your in-game keybinds for equipment selection and equipment use.

The script will intercept the "Equipment Switch" input and fire both the "Equipment Switch" and "Use Equipment" inputs instead.

### Options
The "Grapple with Use Equipment key" option makes the "Use Equipment" key fire the grappleshot.  
This is useful when you want to use the same key for "Use Equipment" in multiplayer and "Fire Grappleshot" in singleplayer.
