## How it works
The script will intercept the **Equip Slot** input and fire both the **Equipment Slot** and **Use Equipment** inputs.  
Equip Slot keys will deploy the equipment with the same key press instead of the tedious switching.

### Running as an AutoHotkey script
 - Clone (or download as zip) the project and run the InstantDeploy.ahk file with AutoHotkey

### Running as a standalone executable
 - Download and run the standalone executable from [releases](https://github.com/Kevinvdbij/halo-infinite-instant-deploy/releases).

## Keybinds
You can change the bindings by clicking on the **Set** buttons in the **Instant Deploy** window and pressing your desired key.  

The configured keybinds need to match your in-game keybinds for equipment slots and use.

## Options
##### Grapple with Use Equipment key
Makes the **Use Equipment** key fire the grappleshot.  
This lets you use the same key for equipment in multiplayer as the grappleshot in singleplayer.

##### Show window on start
This option determines whether the **Instant Deploy** window is visible when you start the script.
